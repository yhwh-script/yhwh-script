# yhwh-script

There is nothing so complicated that it can't be made simple. yhwh-script is an advanced, yet minimalistic WebComponents framework featuring most of the functionality of popular JavaScript frameworks, but in a fraction of their complexity and therefore minimizing the effort of refactoring your code. It is written in vanilla JavaScript and you can freely customize it to fit your needs.

yhwh-script is solely built on <a title="Vite" href="https://vitejs.dev"><img height="20" alt="Vitejs-logo" src="https://vitejs.dev/logo.svg"></a> and an optional <a title="SQLite" href="https://sqlite.org/wasm"><img height="20" alt="SQLite-logo" src="https://sqlite.org/images/sqlite370_banner.gif"></a> database.

## Features

- written in vanilla JavaScript
- support for (nesting) SingleFile WebComponents (SFCs) in dedicated .html files
- direct access to shadowDocument in each component's script
- following W3C standards and MDN-recommended best practices with just a few hacks to accomplish things where people claim: *"This is impossible with WebComponents"*
- built for SinglePageApplications (SPAs)
- full reactivity support via bubbling events (up) and observers (down)
- support for reactive state changes via state attribute
- support for dynamic imports of JavaScript modules
- offline capabilities
- pluggable navigation module using history-driven Component Router ( in examples sub-project )
- SQLite WebAssembly (WASM) for global state management
- use of OriginPrivateFileSystem (OPFS) for domain-private storage
- support for containerized Vite with basicSsl plugin (contact me)
- basic functionality in under <100LOC

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Besides <a title="git" href="https://git-scm.com"><img height="20" alt="GIT-logo" src="https://git-scm.com/images/logo@2x.png"></a> You need to have <a title="NodeJS" href="https://nodejs.org"><img height="20" alt="NodeJS-logo" src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/nodejs/nodejs-ar21.svg"></a> installed. I recommend using <a title="VSCodium" href="https://vscodium.com"><img height="20" alt="VSCodium-logo" src="https://vscodium.com/img/codium_cnl.svg"></a> for development and <a title="chromium" href="https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel/"><img height="20" alt="Chromium-logo" src="https://www.chromium.org/_assets/icon-chromium-96.png"></a> for testing. However, You can use any editor and browser of choice.

### Running 

Running yhwh-script is as easy as cloning a repository.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yhwh-script/sqlite-examples
  cd sqlite-examples
  npm install
```

OR you can use

```bash
  npx @yhwh-script/create-app {your_project}
  cd {your_project}
  npm install
```

and then

```bash
  npm run dev
```

to quickly setup a yhwh-script project. (There is no Vite template support yet, but hopefully they will reach out to me.)

You can then access the app via https://localhost:3443 in your browser.

## Creating

Have you ever thought about creating standards-conforming WebComponents in dedicated HTML-files? Now it's possible to use ```script```, ```style``` and ```template``` fragments and load them dynamically.

![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yhwh-script/elements/main/docs/SFC.png)

That's basically everything. **Happy coding!**

[Examples](https://github.com/yhwh-script/examples/tree/main/) without and [with SQLite support](https://github.com/yhwh-script/sqlite-examples/tree/main/) can be found in the corresponding sub-project. It is recommended to use SQLite examples for demonstration purposes and if you need local-persistent state!

## API description and restrictions

Here are some further features You can use in a .html file

- use dynamic ```await import``` to include your own modules
- ```shadowDocument``` is the private scope DOM of the SFC to access inner-component elements. You can use most methods that are also available on the default ```document``` DOM, for instance ```shadowDocument.getElementById(...)``` or  ```shadowDocument.querySelector(...)```. (Yes, you can also add syntactic sugar and define your own shorthand versions of access methods like

```
const $ = (query) => shadowDocument.querySelector(query);
const $$ = (query) => shadowDocument.querySelectorAll(query);
```

but by default they are now removed from the latest release.

## Component Lifecycle

In case you want some deeper insights you should learn and understand how the ![WebComponents lifecycle](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements#custom_element_lifecycle_callbacks) is working.

![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yhwh-script/yhwh-script/main/docs/components-lifecycle.png)

1. prefetch html components in [index.html](https://github.com/ProphetsAI/jsonly/blob/main/index.html)
2. declare your custom elements in the [./elements/index.js](https://github.com/yhwh-scrip/yhwh-script/blob/main/elements/index.js) (this happens automatically when you run ```npm run dev```)
3. After having created your custom elements you can instantiate them programmatically or by tag-name like in the [animals-view.html](https://github.com/yhwh-script/examples/blob/main/elements/animals/animals-view.html) (Check out [the other examples](https://github.com/yhwh-script/examples/blob/main/elements/) to see variations.)
4. changing the state of a component is possible via the event bubbling from inside or by changing the attribute ```data-state``` of the host element.

## Adding a navigation 

Adding a navigation is very easy. You can have [an entire navigation in one single html file](https://github.com/yhwh-script/sqlite-examples/blob/main/elements/home/home-navigation.html) defined as just another component. After having it integrated into your app

![nav integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yhwh-script/examples/main/docs/nav-component.png)

it could look like this:

![Navigation example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yhwh-script/yhwh-script/main/docs/nav.png)

Of course you are completely free to customize the themes and make them awesome!
